I am a De Vinci Innovation Center student in the Creative Technologist major, part of the "Artificial Life" group. 
I am passionate about science, space, music, technology, psychology, and video games. 

I am also working on an augmented mirror project, which calculates and displays a projection of the user's coordinates on a screen. 
It includes different modules, including a dance learning and a sign language program.

I like to explore horizons, touch, and be interested in everything because I think you can't like what you don't know. 
I always want to find and master tools to express my creativity. 
I am very interested in flexible electronics and wearable technologies, and I am convinced that conductive ink will play a significant role 
in these sectors in the future. I am also fascinated by the possibilities opened by Artificial Intelligence and its capacity to change the world, 
and I would potentially like to point me in this direction.
